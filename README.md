# agda-sdg
Basic SIA / SDG in Agda

A basic implementation of synthetic differential geometry in Agda following roughly the developments in Kock's Synthetic Differential Geometry and Bell's A Primer of Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis.

This library is intended to eventually serve as a basis for a verified implementation in Agda of forward-mode automatic differentiation.

Not to be confused with [sdg-agda](https://github.com/konn/sdg-agda).
